# Today's meeting discussion summary:

First, we wrote down our doubts on the docs.

## Then, we discussed each doubt one by one, such as:

- What is Markdown?
- Why do we write .md?
- What is dev mode?
- Why do we write JS inside HTML elements?

We also set a target for tomorrow: to complete Unit 3.

After that, we shared our individual progress: what we're working on, where we've applied, and where we're heading.

## Finally, we decided on what to bring to tomorrow's meeting:

1. Write down all doubts on the docs.
2. Note down the answers to the doubts we cleared during the discussion.
3. Set a daily target and try to achieve as much as possible.
